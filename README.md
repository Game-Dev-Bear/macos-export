# macos-export

### **ABOUT**
---
This is a simple python script that converts python files into a MacOS application.
In order to use this, you need to open `build.py`. Once you have opened this file,
go to the bottom where the `export` function is called.

### **WARNING**
---
This script is in ALPHA. There will be bugs with getting all the files, compatability,
and it will later be a command line tool. Use at your own risk. I am not responsible for
any sort of damage to your project.

### **HOW TO USE**
---
The `export` function has a number of paremeters:
* FILES - *a list of extra local files*
* EXTRA - *a list of extra local folders*
* REQUIREMENTS - *a list of all modules required by pip*
* NAME - *the name of the application*

Other parameters are not implemented yet.

### **ALLOWED USE**
---
You can use this for any project you want without credit. Feel free to edit this however you want.
However, I am not responsible for your use. That is up to you.
